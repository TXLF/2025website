If you've followed Texas Linux Fest in recent editions, you probably
recognize Helena Spease from the marketing and outreach efforts that
get reminder emails into the inboxes of attendees, the announcements of
speakers, and the recruitment of the on-site volunteers that keep the
event running in the track rooms and exhibit area.

Given that she's taken on the role of reminding people to put TXLF on their personal
calendars, I asked her for some behind-the-scenes insights into that
process ... and for one final reminder to join us at Texas Linux Fest
on Saturday.

__Nate__: "So, the most basic question first: how many years is it
you've been at Texas Linux Fest?"

__Helena__: "This is my second year. I work for an open-source
foundation: The Open Infra Foundation, if you're heard of that. We
host the OpenStack project and, in that role, what I do is manage our
community days. In expanding our community days, I was looking at
other community events, like the various Linux Fests and SCaLE. We're
always looking for collaboration opportunities, and the Open Infra
community expressed interest in co-locating and things like that, so I
started volunteering for Texas Linux Fest."

__Nate__: "So what did you do that first year?"

__Helena__: "Same thing; I volunteered for marketing and volunteer
coordination. Last year, there was a co-location with KCD, and the KCD
organizers actually pulled all the volunteers for us, through
UT. Then, this year, my landlord is a UT professor; I asked him to
help send out a call for volunteers to his students, and that's how we
got them this year. You'll see them tomorrow. Actually, some have
probably shown up; they're probably here enjoying the conference
because they get a free ticket. They do things along the lines of like
helping out at the registration desk, t-shirt distribution, and room
proctoring is a big one.

On the marketing things, any time that an attendee gets an email
with helpful information or a spelling mistake, that comes from me. Or
any sort of promotional things, like the social media channels and the
email marketing."

__Nate__: "Looking back on that first year, what stood out to you as the
most fun dimension? Or, what have you decided you want to do
differently this time?"

__Helena__: "I thought it was really interesting when you link to a 'Linux
Fest,' you're thinking, like, "operating system," and highly 'technical'
people and things. But then, when you actually talk to the people in
the planning committee, yeah, you do have a lot of those people who
are highly technical, but then you also have, like (TXLF designer)
Beck: he's there and knows things like photo editing with open
source. For me, not being a 'technical' person, in more marketing
roles, it's really interesting to see this diversity in the sorts of
open source tooling that people are interested in.

This year, we migrated our email marketing. Now we're on Listmonk,
which is an open source marketing tool. A fun one is last year I used
Figma for social media, but this year, since Beck recommended it, we
used Penpot. It's basically like a one-to-one, alternative to
Figma. It works great, so that's pretty big."

__Nate__: "Oh; I think I've heard of it mostly in terms of making
mock-ups."

__Helena__: "Yeah, it's used for wireframing. But you can use it for
actual production. Email headers, social media graphics, and all of
our speaker cards are built in Penpot. So it's real graphic design and
layout."

__Nate__: "What do you think is different about Texas Linux Fest compared
to other community days and meetups?"

__Helena__: "If you look at Open Infra Days or you have a giant non-profit
supporting your event, there's very definitive branding. So it's very
interesting to see that, versus something like Texas Linux Fest. You
still get a very similar event, but people are coming because of the
community, not necessarily because of who's running it. I don't think
there's a negative or positive to either. It's really interesting just
to observe the dynamics.

When it comes to the attendees here, I hear independent feedback here
and it's overwhelmingly like 'Oh my gosh, thank you so much for
organizing this' ... which is so nice to hear. I'm like 'it wasn't
that much but thank you and we're happy you enjoy it. So it's really
nice to see how appreciative people are."


__Nate__: "When it comes to the emails you send out, what is the plan
like? Is there a formula?"

__Helena__: "You'll see the normal kind of marketing calendar we follow
is, like: registration launch, price increases, schedule, launching
the CFP, closing the CFP; those kinds of schedule timelines. And then,
with those kinds of campaigns, you'll see like spikes in
registration. A big one is if you announce a keynote speaker. And,
then, the one week to price increases, one week the CFP closes. Those
are where you get your major spikes.

The biggest thing ever, in the years of events I've done, is you
__will__ stress until the last minute because everyone is a
procrastinator and will not register — especially for something local
like Texas Linux Fest — because they can drive their car over here, or
walk or take the bus, they will not register until the night before,
or three days before.

And you'll stress up until those moments, like, 'No One's Gonna show
up!'"

__Nate__: "Yeah; and one reason that I think we should post these
interviews in the run-up is to remind people.

So: it's tomorrow, or possibly 'today', depending, as you're reading this! What would you tell people
who think they want to attend, but haven't bought their ticket yet?"

__Helena__: "Buy it early! I mean, you can always get a refund on your
ticket."

__Nate__: "Oh, that's a good point. I don't know if everyone knows
that...."

__Helena__: "Yes, that's true. Refunds are a thing. Buy it early because
us, as organizers, we have a budget we're working on, and we need
those numbers earlier rather than later."

__Nate__: "If someone hasn't bought their ticket? Does that mean they
should just stay home Saturday?" 

__Helena__: "No no; just show up. You can get a ticket on site!"

__Nate__: "I like to think that people who have not bought their ticket
are doing so because they have other conflicts in their schedule, and
they're just like 'I don't know if I'll be able to make it.' But you
run the risk of forgetting."

__Helena__: "Sure. And it's always hard in Austin, specifically. It used
to be we had two major events ACL and South By Southwest, right? And
now, the festival culture has become a thing, and it's like
every single weekend, there's a festival of some sort in Austin. 
Now, with all these competing events in the city, it gets really
difficult to draw audiences one every single weekend.

And Texas Linux Fest definitely fits into the Austin culture, for
sure. Austin has a certain vibe of how things are put together? With
community in mind. Well, it's a little bit rebellious, okay. But it's
community oriented, and it's relaxed, I guess. It's not a high stress
conference we're talking about."

__Nate__: "So, to summarize for the night before, if you were thinking of
coming to Texas Linux Fest tomorrow? Do. And if you weren't thinking
of it, change your mind and come anyway, because you can still get a
ticket out the door." 

__Helena__: "Yes. And _next_ year buy it early. And get on the
newsletter. And the planning committee could always use more
people. There's seats available!"

__Nate__: "Yeah, and you know the call for papers will be open again
before you know it. Is there anything else you want to add? What don't
people know?"

__Helena__: "Get barbecue. But we don't have it here on site. Go somewhere
else and get barbecue. Maybe you can bring it here; there are big
tables. Probably just don't bring it into the talks."

Technically, it seems like bringing in outside food might be an iffy
proposition, but we **do** have it on good authority that the venue is close
to all sorts of eating establishments. You can drop by Texas Linux
Fest 2025 Saturday, October 4, whether you have purchased a ticket in
advance or not, and you can say thanks to Helena for all her work
getting the word out.
