This is an overview on how my company actually runs CentOS Stream in
production. Discussion will be centered around management of the infrastructure
and how we handle OS updates. This includes discussions around various
technologies that we use to manage the fleet; such as Jenkins, Cobbler,
SaltStack, Koji, Dist-Git, etc. Third party vendor application support is
discussed.
