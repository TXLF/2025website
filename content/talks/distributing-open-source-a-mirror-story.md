Community mirroring is a cornerstone of successful open-source projects,
ensuring fast, reliable, and widespread access to software and updates for a
global user base.  This talk delves into the critical role of community mirrors
in the AlmaLinux ecosystem.  We'll explore how AlmaLinux, a free,
community-owned and governed enterprise Linux distribution, leverages its
mirrorlist infrastructure to distribute its operating system and packages
efficiently, and why this nearly 30-year-old approach to distribution reigns
supreme in the age of CDNs and hyperscale clouds.
