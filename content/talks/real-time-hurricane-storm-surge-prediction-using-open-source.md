The ADCIRC Surge Guidance System (ASGS), first discussed formally in 2008, is a
portable real-time operational storm surge forecasting framework.  It continues
to be forged and honed with each passing Atlantic hurricane seasons since 2008.
ASGS has been used to deliver critical, time sensitive information to emergency
managers on federal, state, and local levels in Louisiana, Texas, and North
Carolina and within groups such FEMA, NOAA, and DHS.  Over these years it has
saved millions of dollars in time, property, and emergency assets.  It has also
likely saved many lives1.  This talk discusses its origins as a collaboration
between LSU and UNC in the wake of interest in such systems after Hurricane
Katrina (2005), to its first real test during Hurricane Gustav2 (2008, path
shown in Figure 5), and up to the modern day.  ASGS has been used successfully
to assist the community since then.  This talk also discusses the technical
aspects of the system: the essential core of the system, the ADCIRC finite
element coast ocean model; how the user experience has been tailored for
real-time operations, and the technical decisions that have been made leading
directly to its success as a robust and adaptable framework for operational
use.  Most relevant for the intended audience is that is shown, i how using
Perl, Bash shell scripting, and standard Unix tools has made all of this
possible.
