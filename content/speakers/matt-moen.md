Paul Novarese is a Principal Solutions Engineer at Hunted Labs.  He has been
working in open source software for over 25 years, specializing in enterprise
infrastructure/operations, security and containers.  Recently, he has been
studying the industry response to Log4Shell, particularly examining how
application developers, security teams and DevOps practitioners in the trenches
responded, looking for what worked and what didn't.  In his spare time, he
enjoys amateur mycology and hiking with his dog, Bella.
