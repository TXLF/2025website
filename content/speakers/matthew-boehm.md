My name is Matthew (not Matt). I've been with Percona for 11 years, and have
been working with MySQL for 6 years before that. I've held positions at
Rackspace, Dell, PayPal, and Ebay. As Principal MySQL Consultant at Percona,
I've helped customers who process one of the credit cards in your wallet,
handle your healthcare insurance claims, and ensure your recent ATM deposit was
properly accounted. And speaking of One Direction... well.. just watch this :-)
